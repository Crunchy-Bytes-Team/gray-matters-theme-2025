# Code Style Guide

> Version: 1.0.0

## Context

This file is part of the Agent OS standards system. These global code style rules are referenced by all product codebases and provide default formatting guidelines. Individual projects may extend or override these rules in their `.agent-os/product/code-style.md` file.

## General Formatting

### Indentation
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- Maintain consistent indentation throughout files
- Align nested structures for readability

### Naming Conventions
- **Methods and Variables**: Use snake_case (e.g., `user_profile`, `calculate_total`)
- **Classes and Modules**: Use CamelCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `PaymentProcessor`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)

### String Formatting
- Use single quotes for strings: `'Hello World'`
- Use double quotes only when interpolation is needed
- Use template literals for multi-line strings or complex interpolation

## HTML/Template Formatting

### Structure Rules
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Place nested elements on new lines with proper indentation
- Content between tags should be on its own line when multi-line

### Attribute Formatting
- Place each HTML attribute on its own line
- Align attributes vertically
- When using Slim template language, avoid applying new lines for each attribute since it will break syntax

## Code Comments

### When to Comment
- Add brief comments above non-obvious business logic
- Document complex algorithms or calculations
- Explain both the "what" and the "why" behind implementation choices

### Comment Maintenance
- Never remove existing comments unless removing the associated code
- Update comments when modifying code to maintain accuracy
- Keep comments concise and relevant

### Comment Format
```ruby
# Calculate compound interest with monthly contributions
# Uses the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT Ã— (((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n))
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, monthly_payment)
  # Implementation here
end
```
