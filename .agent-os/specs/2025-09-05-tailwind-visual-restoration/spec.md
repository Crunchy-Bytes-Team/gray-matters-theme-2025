# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Tailwind Visual Restoration
> Created: 2025-09-05

## Overview

Restore the complete visual design and styling of the Dawn Shopify theme using Tailwind CSS classes to match the original appearance after removing all legacy CSS files. This comprehensive styling project will rebuild all visual components, layouts, typography, spacing, and interactive elements using Tailwind's utility-first approach to maintain the theme's professional e-commerce design while leveraging modern CSS practices.

## User Stories

### Store Owner Visual Consistency
As a store owner, I want my theme to look identical to the original Dawn design after the Tailwind migration, so that my customers experience a familiar, professional, and visually appealing storefront without any styling disruptions.

The store owner expects all pages (homepage, product pages, collections, cart, checkout, account pages) to maintain their original visual hierarchy, spacing, colors, typography, and interactive states. Every component should feel polished and consistent with Shopify's design standards.

### Customer Shopping Experience
As a customer, I want to navigate and shop on a visually consistent and responsive website, so that I can easily browse products, read content, and complete purchases across all devices.

Customers expect smooth interactions, proper hover states, readable typography, intuitive navigation, and mobile-responsive design that works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops.

### Developer Maintenance Experience
As a developer, I want all styling to be implemented with Tailwind utilities, so that I can easily maintain, modify, and extend the theme's visual design without hunting through legacy CSS files.

Developers need consistent class naming, responsive design patterns, and well-organized styling that follows Tailwind best practices for long-term maintainability.
